Many anime fans may have inadvertently started with the likes of Dragon Ball Z.
The show was wildly popular throughout the ’90s. However, many of those viewers
may not have gone on to become long-term fans of the genre. This, too, 
was almost my story. It wasn’t until over a decade later that I got back 
into anime through a series of circumstances. I quickly went from being a
casual watcher to an avid fan obsessed with the world of anime.
